# Climate Forecasting Model with Prophet: Exploratory Data Analysis and Statistical Comparison
---
- The dataset consist of 4 parameters (mean temperature, humidity, wind speed, and mean pressure) measured during a period of 5 years approximately. The objective of this project is to develop a forecasting model that can predict the values of a variable of interest, in this case, temperature. To achieve this, we will first conduct an exploratory data analysis to understand the characteristics of the data.  We will then utilize the Prophet package to construct a predictive model, incorporating additional variables such as humidity and average pressure to enhance the model's performance. Finally, we will perform a statistical analysis to compare the model's performance with and without the additional regressor variables.
- The dataset used in this project was obtained from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthvrao/daily-climate-time-series-data
